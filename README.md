#Eloquent JS project - platform game

Part of my efforts to learn DOM manipulation in js w/o the jQuery crutch

Majority of this was just made following tutorial from the book

End chapter exercises that I programmed myself:




###future plans
* need to do end chapter exercises
* don't forget the adjustments to make to it in the next chapters (images)
* turn this into my idea for an editable "make your own mini platformer" - edit game/map layout, lots of physics options, etc.
* change it so their is a minimum number of coins to get to win level, extra coins go toward score/lives/whatever
* add new actors to game
